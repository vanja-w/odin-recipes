          </li>

          <li>Mayu (black garlic oil) or chili oil, to taste 1</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the pork broth. Transfer the trotters to a large stock pot and
        cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then remove from
        the heat and drain in a colander, discarding the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using chopsticks, clean the bones under cold running water to remove any
        red or brown blood or organ pieces.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer the cleaned bones to a clean stock pot.</li>
      <li>
        In a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, toast the green
        onions, yellow onion, and ginger, turning occasionally, until the
        aromatics are charred in places.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add charred aromatics to the stock pot with the cleaned bones and cover
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any scum that floats to the
        surface. Continue to boil and skim for 20 minutes, then cover and reduce
        to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue simmering, adding enough water as needed to keep bones and
        aromatics covered, until broth is opaque, about 6 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover and bring to a boil. Let broth reduce to desired thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer and refrigerate overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        When cool, bone broth should be very thick and gelatinous, and there
        should be a layer of fat on top of the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a stock pot, bring pork bone broth and pork fat to a simmer over
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>Season to taste with salt and soy sauce.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Cook ramen noodles in boiling water according to package directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the ramen noodles between two bowls and ladle the pork broth over
        the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top each bowl with two slices of chashu pork, enoki mushrooms, and
        menma.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tuck a nori sheet in between the side of the bowl and an egg half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the bowls with green onions and sesame seeds, and drizzle with
        mayu and/or chili oil, as desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
