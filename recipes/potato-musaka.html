    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This easy Serbian ground beef potato moussaka is a nourishing casserole
      you’ll learn love from the first try. This dish is truly a uniting meal,
      and it’s made the same way in Bosnia, Croatia, and Macedonia too.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 lb (680 g) ground beef/pork/turkey/ or combo</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>5-8 large yellow potatoes, sliced thin</li>
      <li>3 tbsp (30 g) Vegeta seasoning</li>
      <li>1 tsp (3 g) garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (10 g) paprika (Aleva Paprika)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp (5 g) black pepper</li>
      <li>Oil (I use sunflower)</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (120 g) sour cream/Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>1 cup (250 ml) milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brown your ground meat in a skillet, breaking up the meat with a wooden
        spoon as it browns. If using a very lean meat like turkey, add in about
        1 tbsp of oil. When it browns completely, add in the yellow onion and
        continue to brown until any liquid is evaporated and the meat begins to
        saute/fry in the pan. See note below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the meat with garlic powder, 1 tbsp of Vegeta, black pepper, and
        paprika. Salt to taste. Stir well and make sure all meat is covered.
        Taste and adjust for seasoning and remove from heat. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine about 3 tbsp (15 ml) of oil, 2 tbsp of Vegeta,
        and 1 tsp (6 g) of salt. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel potatoes. Using a sharp knife or mandolin, slice each potato into
        thin slices (see photo in slideshow above). Transfer potato slices to
        the bowl with oil and seasoning. Stir and ensure all potato slices are
        covered in oil. Continue to do this with the addition of each sliced
        potato.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375F (200 C). Prepare a 9 x 13 casserole dish by spray
        with cooking spray or brushing oil on the bottom and sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the ingredients into the baking dish, first covering the bottom
        with a layer of seasoned potatoes, then meat, potatoes, and so on until
        you have used up all of your ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the egg custard. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, sour cream,
        milk, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk until all ingredients are
        combined. Pour this mixture over the Musaka making sure it is
        distributed evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. At the 30
        minute mark, remove the aluminum foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes
        or until the potatoes on top turn a golden brown. Test for doneness by
        using a fork and ensure potatoes in the Musaka are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        When fully cooked, let the Musaka rest for 15-20 minutes before serving.
      </li>
